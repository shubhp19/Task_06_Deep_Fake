🎤 Script: AI Interview on Sports Stats Project (Task 06)

[Interviewer]:
Hey there! I heard you’ve been working on some sports data analysis. Can you tell us what the project was all about?

[You]:
Yeah, sure! I analyzed data from the Syracuse Men’s Basketball 2024–2025 season. The idea was to see how well AI could understand structured data, like player stats, and answer questions in plain language.

[Interviewer]:
Interesting! What kind of data were you looking at?

[You]:
We had season-level stats for 16 players—things like points, assists, rebounds, minutes played, field goal percentage, and so on. I cleaned the data in Python and also built some custom metrics.

[Interviewer]:
Custom metrics? What do you mean?

[You]:
I created a player impact score using a simple formula: Points + Assists + Rebounds. It helped identify not just who scored the most, but who contributed overall. I also filtered out bench players and visualized the top scorers with bar charts.

[Interviewer]:
So where does AI come in?

[You]:
I used ChatGPT-4 to answer some natural language questions based on the data—like “Who is the top scorer?” or “Who’s the most consistent performer?” Then I validated the AI’s answers using Python to see how accurate it was.

[Interviewer]:
Nice! How did the AI do?

[You]:
Honestly, it did pretty well. It got all the numeric questions right, even handled my custom formula and chart requests. The consistency question was more subjective, but still reasonable.

[Interviewer]:
What did you learn from doing this?

[You]:
Definitely how to combine code and AI in meaningful ways. Writing the prompts clearly made a huge difference, and I learned that even small data import issues—like Excel formatting errors—can throw things off if you don’t clean them properly.

[Interviewer]:
Sounds like you picked up a bunch of skills. Thanks for sharing!

[You]:
Thanks! It was a fun project and a cool way to mix Python, AI, and sports analytics.
